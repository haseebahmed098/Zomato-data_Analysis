# Zomato Dataset Analysis & Prediction

## Overview
This project performs data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and machine learning modeling on a Zomato dataset to extract meaningful insights and predict restaurant ratings.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning:** Handles missing values, renames columns, and converts categorical data into numerical format.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Provides insights through histograms and scatter plots.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Uses a Random Forest Regressor to predict restaurant ratings based on available features.
- **Data Export:** Saves the processed dataset for further use.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Libraries:
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
Run the Python script to process the dataset and generate insights:
```bash
python zomato_analysis.py
```

## Output
- Data visualization graphs
- Model performance metrics
- Processed dataset saved as `Processed_Zomato_Data.csv`

## Contribution
Feel free to fork this repository and contribute to improving the analysis and prediction models.
